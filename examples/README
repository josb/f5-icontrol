Note that the example programs require the getoptions gem
(http://rubyforge.org/projects/getoptions/).

Before trying to run the examples, please make sure that:
- config.yaml has valid setup information; use the --config_file option when
  invoking the scripts to point to it.
- the code can find the .wsdl files identified in config.yaml.

If when running the examples under ruby-1.9.2 you see the message
  
  RuntimeError: XML processor module not found.

you may want to edit lib/xsd/xmlparser.rb, line 66.

Change

  c.downcase == name

to

  c.to_s.downcase == name

Also note that soap4r seems to have other issues when used with 1.9. The
following fork (not packaged as a gem, it seems) may or may not work:
